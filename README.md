# Introduction
A desktop client for Google's Bard AI chatbot made with Electron.

## Details
This application is made with the help of electron. Electron is used to create desktop application so for now, android or IOS is out of question. The basic purpose of this application is relieve the user of visiting the site to access Bard over and over again. Why I chose Bard will be discussed later. All you need to do now is to run:

- `npm run package-win`,  or
- `npm run package-linux`,  or
- `npm run package-mac`,

for Windows, Linux, or MacOS respectively.
