# Introduction
A desktop client for Google's Bard AI chatbot made with Electron.

## Details
This application is made with the help of Electron. Electron is used to create desktop applications, so for now, versions for android or IOS is out of question. The basic purpose of this application is to relieve the user from visiting the site to access Bard over and over again. Why I chose Bard will be discussed later. 

In order to build the project according to your operating system, run the following command:

- `npm run package-win`,
- `npm run package-linux`,
- `npm run package-mac`,

for Windows, Linux, and MacOS respectively.

### Requirments

In order to build the project, we need Node.js, more specifically npm. It is needed to create the package for your particular operating system. Standalone executables will be released later, but to get it going right now, running npm is the only way.
